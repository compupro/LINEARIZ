# LINEARIZ
TI Basic program that shows linear regression residuals after Tukey ladder of powers operations done on Lists 1 and 2

If you put independent variable data in List 1 and explanatory/dependent variable data in List 2, the program will step through different operations in the Tukey ladder of powers and show the residual plot generated after a linear regression. Pressing the right arrow key moves to the next operation and pressing any other button (except ON) moves the the previous operation. The operation being done is shown on the top left of the screen. Note that log(XY actually refers to log(x), log(y).
